# rpi-sensehat-mqtt

This a Python application for the *Raspberry Pi* (RPi) that allows interfacing with the [RPi SenseHAT](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/sense-hat.html) over MQTT. The project is a fork of [mirkodcompataretti's rpi-sense-hat](https://github.com/mirkodcomparetti/rpi-sensehat_mqtt) that ended up being greatly modified to reflect my own idea of implementation.

## Emulator

If you do not own a Raspberry Pi or a SenseHAT or both, you can emulate the SenseHAT on pretty much any system via the [SenseHAT Emulator](https://github.com/astro-pi/python-sense-emu/). This is particularly useful for development but you can also use your virtual SenseHAT to send (and to receive) messages from the MQTT broker just as if you had a physical SenseHAT. Check the [installation instructions](https://sense-emu.readthedocs.io/en/v1.1/install.html?highlight=cairo#alternate-platforms) and give it a try (it's pretty fun!).
